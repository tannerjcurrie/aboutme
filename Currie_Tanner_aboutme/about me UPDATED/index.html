    <p class="grey-copy"> 
            Hey, I'm Tanner Currie. I was born on December 9th, 1999 at Met Hospital in Windsor, ON. My parents are Colette Bezaire and Wayne Currie and I am the youngest of their four children. I have two older brothers, and an older sister. Their names are Brandon, 27, Shane, 24, and Sierra, 22. I am 18 years old and graduated in 2017 from Cardinal Carter Secondary School. I applied to St. Clair College's program for Graphic Design due to my interest in the arts. I love expressing my creativity through visuals and being able to see my designs become reality. I plan on futherering my education by attending Sheridan for Illustration, if I have the funding, haha.

                I love art, nature and animals. I try to take daily nature walks in the forest or midnight strolls. My family had a pet cat who lived until the age of twenty and his name was Junior. He was perfect and he died on June 22, 2018, rest in peace dude. I love all forms of art, especially music and visual arts. Lorde and Frank Ocean are two my favourite musical artists.
